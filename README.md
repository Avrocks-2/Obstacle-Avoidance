# Obstacle-Avoidance
Code to optimize path planning and obstacle avoidance of Purdue's COVID-19 disinfecting robot

The code achieves 3 important deliverables. The first one is to add bounding obstacles to the map for legged objects. The second is to optimize the path travelled by the robot,i.e path planning and the third is to find the shortest obstacle free path between co-ordinates.
