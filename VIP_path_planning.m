%% Order Interchange

% NOTE: The order interchange doesn't refer to the exchange between two 
% points. Every point in the loop path will interchange its poisiton 
% accordingly with its matched point.

    for i=1:2:NP
        for j=1:N
            if rand<pc

                A=find(nf(i,:)==nf(i+1,j));
                nf(i,A)=nf(i,j);
                B=find(nf(i+1,:)==nf(i,j));
                nf(i+1,B)=nf(i+1,j);

                temp1=nf(i+1,j);
                nf(i+1,j)=nf(i,j);
                nf(i,j)=temp1;
            end
        end
    end
    
%% Variation Operation

% It means to pick some points for change instead of exchange orders, which
% can achieve the target if it is close to the result. For example, the
% right order follows point oder 2-4-6-3-7-1-5-2 for a shortest loop path 
% through seven points. And now what we have is 2-7-6-3-4-1-5-2. At these
% point, it can be efficient if the MATLAb operation is samrt/lucky enough
% to pick up 2nd and 5th points to make a change.

% NOTE: Variation Operation is different from order interchange. It is only
% partial adjustment of the loop path, which is quick to operate, but can 
% also be effectiveless.

    for i=1:NP
        for j=1:N
            if rand<pm
                temp2=nf(i,j);
                temp3=randi([1,N],1,1);
                A=find(nf(i,:)==temp3);
                nf(i,j)=temp3;
                nf(i,A)=temp2; 
            end

%% Result Output
% This figure is to straightforward show the optimized path after G times
% of iteration. The blue line represents the optimized loop path. The red
% section line means the starting points and the first direction to go
% according to the optimized results. But it actually doesn't matter too
% much in our project, since it's a loop, the start point doesn't influence
% the total length of path to go.

% This figure is to show the operation of self-learning and the
% effectiveness of the path optimization. If the target functions varies
% drastically corresponding to the interation number, then it means the
% iteration is working properly. When the target function doesn't vary
% much, it means the solution is kind of optimized to the best of its
